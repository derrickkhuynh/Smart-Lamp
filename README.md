# IoT Smart Lamp
Created a pair of smart lamps that connect to the Wifi and has additional features when both lamps are on. 
Includes display option that displays time, weather and custom message.

Utilizes an ESP32 MCU, a neopixel ring, TFT Display, and a capactive sensor of your choice.

There are 2 different version of the code:
1. noDisplay.cpp -> only lamp portion
2. display.cpp   -> lamp +TFT display

## Features:
Simple touch on/off, unlimited color customization, provides current time, date and weather, customized message sending.
